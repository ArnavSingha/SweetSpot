# SweetSpot: Full-Stack E-Commerce & Inventory Management

SweetSpot is a modern, full-stack e-commerce application built with Next.js and the App Router. It serves as a production-quality demonstration of building a feature-rich web application—including user authentication, an admin dashboard, and real-time inventory control—using a simplified, monolithic architecture without a separate backend API.

The application functions as a digital storefront for a sweet shop, allowing customers to browse products, while providing administrators with the tools to manage inventory and view sales data.
